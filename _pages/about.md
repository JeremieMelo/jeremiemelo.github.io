I am currently a Ph.D. student at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), working with Prof. [David Z. Pan](http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~dpan/) and co-advised by Prof. [Ray T. Chen](http://www.mrc.utexas.edu/people/faculty/ray-chen).
Previously, I received the B.E. degree in microelectronic science and engineering from [Fudan University](http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/), in 2018.

My current research interests include machine learning, algorithm and architecture design, software/hardware co-design for neuromorphic computing,  and GPU acceleration for VLSI physical design automation.
