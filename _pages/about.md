I received my Ph.D. degree at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), in 2023, advised by Prof. [David Z. Pan](http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~dpan/) and co-advised by Prof. [Ray T. Chen](http://www.mrc.utexas.edu/people/faculty/ray-chen), and received the B.E. degree in microelectronic science and engineering from [Fudan University](http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/), in 2018.

My current research interests include
 * Emerging Hardware Design for Efficient Computing
   * Efficient AI hardware design
   * Electronic-photonic mixed-signal platform for high-performance, energy-efficient computing
 * Efficient Algorithm, Co-Design & Automation
   * Hardware-algorithm co-design for emerging hardware (photonics, post-CMOS electronics, quantum)
   * Efficient ML model/algorithm
   * Design automation for electronic-photonic heterogeneous platforms
 * Parallel Computing and GPU Acceleration for VLSI Physical Design Automation

I have received the Best Paper Award at ASP-DAC 2020, the Best Paper Finalist at DAC 2020, the Best Poster Award at NSF Workshop on Machine Learning Hardware (2020), and the Best Paper Award at IEEE TCAD 2021. I have won the ACM/SIGDA Student Research Competition First Place (2020), the ACM Student Research Competition Grand Finals First Place (2021), the Robert S. Hilbert Memorial Optical Design Competition 2022, and Margarida Jacome Dissertation Prize at UT Austin ECE (2023).
