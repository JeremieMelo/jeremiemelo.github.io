We release **[TorchONN](https://github.com/JeremieMelo/pytorch-onn)**,
an open-source PyTorch-centric optical neural network library.
We support fast and scalable development, training, and optimization of customized ONN layers and models.
The tool runs on both CPU and GPU.
CUDA-accelerated batched operators achieves 10-50X speedup over CPU-based matrix decomposition and unitary group parametrization.
