We release **[TorchQuantum](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/torchquantum)**,
an open-source PyTorch-centric hybrid classical-quantum machine learning framework.
We support easy construction of parameterized quantum circuits in PyTorch; bach mode inference and training on CPU/GPU;dynamic computation graph for easy debugging; and easy deployment on real quantum devices such as IBMQ.
We can support more than 26-qubit simulation with order-of-magnitude faster speed than PennyLane.
The official website is at [qmlsys](https://qmlsys.mit.edu/).
